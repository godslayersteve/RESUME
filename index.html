            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am Steve Samuel Menezes ,   I was born and brought up in the beautiful city of Mangalore , Karnataka . Currently I am currently pursuing Bachelors of Commerce at Padua College of Commerce and Management and I am an ACCA aspirant.As a B.Com student and an ACCA aspirant, I am passionate about finance and accounting, and eager to learn from practical experiences. I have demonstrated academic excellence, achieving a CGPA of above 9 out of 10 for the previous four semesters, and earning multiple accounting certifications, such as the National Accounting Talent Search Exam ( both junior and senior levels ) and the DELF A1 in French.

I have also gained valuable insights into the professional world through my internship at NBS & CO, a reputable accounting firm in Mangalore, where I assisted with documentation and bookkeeping tasks, and applied my skills in GST and Tally ERP. I am grateful for the opportunity to work under the guidance of CA Daniel Marsh Pereira, who taught me how to adapt and work efficiently in a fast-paced environment. I am looking forward to further developing my knowledge and skill set through more internships, and connecting with everyone I work with.</p>
